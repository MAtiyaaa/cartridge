## Cartridge 0.7.6 · Steam Fixes

### Fixed
- **Adding games to Steam in Game Mode.** Game Mode starts Steam again the moment it closes, so Cartridge's changes could be lost or never written, and the top bar stayed on "Waiting for Steam…". When Decky Loader is installed, Cartridge now adds games straight into the running Steam, the same way the SteamGridDB plugin changes artwork: shortcut, launch options, artwork and collections, with no restart. Removing works the same way.
- **Restart Steam from Game Mode.** When Decky Loader is installed, Restart Steam asks Steam to restart itself, like the SteamGridDB plugin does.
- **Without Decky Loader**, Cartridge now watches much more closely for Steam closing in Game Mode, so the change is written before Game Mode brings Steam back.

### New
- **Live changes (Settings → Steam).** Shows whether Steam takes changes live. Without Decky Loader, **Turn on** adds the same small file Decky uses to open Steam's interface to apps on this device. Restart Steam once afterwards.

### Changed
- **One "Change metadata" entry in a game's More menu** instead of three. It opens Change cover, Change logo, Change background and Reset artwork.
