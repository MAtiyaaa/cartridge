## Cartridge 0.2.0

The first big update. Everything since 0.1.0 is in here, so this is the only release you need.

### New
- **Search box in the top bar.** Start typing from any screen and results filter as you type. Press Y to jump to it.
- **Game logos.** Home and game pages show the game's logo instead of plain text when your RomM server has one. Turn it off in Settings → Look & feel → Game logos.
- **Media bar.** The top of Home shows artwork of the highlighted game and swaps as you move.
- **Background colors.** Eight PSP XMB-style colors in Settings → Look & feel: Purple, Blue, Red, Green, Orange, Pink, Teal and Midnight.
- **Touch mode.** Tapping the screen no longer shows a mouse cursor. The cursor only appears when a real mouse moves. Pick Auto, Touch or Mouse in Look & feel.
- **In-app updates.** Settings → Updates → Check for updates downloads the new version and swaps it in on restart. Same file, same Steam shortcut, nothing to reinstall.
- **Screenshots.** Quick Menu → Take screenshot saves to `~/Pictures/Cartridge`.
- **One-line installer.** Downloads the AppImage, makes it executable and adds it to your app menu.
- **Add to Steam.** Settings → Steam adds Cartridge as a non-Steam game with its cover, banner, logo and icon.

### Changed
- **No more on-screen keyboard.** Text boxes are real inputs: type with any connected keyboard, or press Steam + X in Game Mode for the Steam keyboard.
- **LT / RT switch tabs** (Home, Library, Consoles, Downloads, Settings). LB / RB flip between consoles or collections.
- **Box art is 2:3**, like Steam, and no longer cropped at the top. Corners are less rounded.
- **Smoother.** Scrolling and focus now hold 60fps on handhelds (up from roughly 25 to 30).

### Fixed
- **Stuck on "Running" when launched from Steam** (Desktop and Game Mode). 0.1.3 switched to GPU rendering, which does not get along with Steam's overlay. Cartridge now uses software rendering whenever Steam or Game Mode launches it, the setup 0.1.2 launched fine with. Launching from the app menu still uses the GPU.
- **Blank grey window and no launch** on some handhelds (0.1.0 and 0.1.1).
- **Duplicate "ready to play" messages** after a download finished.

### Update
Already on 0.1.2 or later: open Cartridge in Desktop Mode, go to Settings → Updates → Check for updates, then restart. Or just close it and open it again.

New install, in Desktop Mode → Konsole:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abdu2304/cartridge/main/install.sh | bash
```
